Some shell scripts i've made in either PS or Bash

## Note!: I am nowhere close to being a pro in scripting ##
>What I'm trying to say is use procaution when using my scripts, as they may open an security risk unintentionally. 
>In case you do use these shell scripts, i hope they help you and remember! I am not liable for anything that goes wrong while executing this! :D
